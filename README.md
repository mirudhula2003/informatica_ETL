Weekly Assignment: Informatica Retail Store Data Processing
Objective: This assignment aims to strengthen your data loading, transformation, and
extraction skills in Informatica. You will work with retail store and employee data files,
transforming and manipulating them according to specific business requirements. The mentor
has provided the required datasets, which are attached.

Assignment Requirements
1. Retail_store file load into another file
○ Load the provided Retail_store dataset file into a new output file.
○ This task is focused on practicing file-to-file ETL transformations in Informatica.
2. Retail_store file load into table stg_retail
○ Load the Retail_store data into the staging table stg_retail in the
database.
○ Ensure accurate data mapping and loading with no errors. This step represents
loading raw data into a staging environment.
3. Create a file of countrynames using country table
○ Extract data from the country table to create a file containing only country
names.
○ This exercise will help you practice extracting specific columns from a table.
4. Create a file for manager_id = 100 using employee table
○ Use the employee table to generate a file with records where manager_id
equals 100.
○ This task focuses on conditional data extraction.
5. Create 3 files for manager_id = 101, 102, 103 using employee table
○ Create separate files from the employee table for each manager_id (101, 102,
and 103).
○ This step reinforces skills in conditional extraction for specific IDs.
6. Union the files created in Assignment 5 and create a single output file
○ Combine the three files created for manager_id 101, 102, and 103 into a single
output file using a union operation.
○ This task will test your ability to use union transformations effectively in
Informatica.

Assignment Instructions
● Informatica Mappings: Create individual mappings for each assignment step.
● Data Validation: Validate each output file and table to confirm data accuracy.
● File Naming: Name each output file descriptively to indicate its purpose.
Deliverables
● Mappings: Exported Informatica mappings for each task.
● Output Files: Output files generated for each assignment step, including the final
unioned file.
